String assignmentExercise - file processing 
(Some aspects like in C programming language)

Read from a file and write to a file.  
Scanner - system.in input and system.out ouput and system.err error


First step - create a project in IDE which creates a file and a folder


1. open a file
2. Read from file and display
3. Then write to another file

Goals (secondary)
Later reading the file and statistics of file like # of characters

Package - in a folder somewhere (e.g. on the Desktop)
Doc program - uses the comment, and author, method arguments to take a method and convert it using html


1. For file processing
	a. Helps to have a file to work with - create it inside a text editor (data.txt)
	b. Scanner() method for infile;
	c. What if the file isn't there...
		i. exception (try simple not expensive handling of errors)
		ii.  throw and throws keywords - for exception handling Ch13 

2. Read from the file
	a. Java does use end of file, try and catch (with exceptions until end of file), or simply while statement

			while(input.hasNext())       //as long as there is a next line continue the loop				

	b. Inside loop - run a input/ouput (see .java code in Canvas)
	c. Close the file - always remember to do this since no compiler error

		* Additional processing line by line in file can be done within a nested loop
	
3. Write output to a file
	a. Path name (also applied to input file)
	b. Function from class PrintWriter associates new file and method
	c. Methods for the class (print, println, printf)
	d. For concurrent writing output to screen AND the file together, ok to have statements back to back



Java file types reads (best file processing among languages).  Binary, Text, Bytecode, and more Advanced concepts (Object).
