Programming Clubs – in different locations, ACM at UCLA, also SMC 
Canvas – Syllabus, assignments
Advanced Java – covers I/O, security, and more

Java Function, e.g. scanf or printf

What is an Object?  Think of it as anything that is given a name is an object.
What is OOP?
What advantages are there of OOP?
	1.  It helps with large or long code problems
	2.
	3.
Working with chosen developer environment


Reminder:  For Assignments to submit source code format (do not zip the files)


From Syllabus – skipping exception handling later in order to get to important chapters 9-11 and 13

Security applications of Java

Use of 'do while' loop that runs forever...
Break (ends the process kicks out of the loop)


Methods - read more and practice with next, nextln() etc. etc
Do not put exit in the method (VERY IMPORTANT).


Writing a class (own)...
Compare two strings (variables) in the class...have to build it
Eg. Two applicances (TV, equal if they have the same volume, or channel)
Eg.

Type
Type is important in java.

Input/Output (topic)
Use of scanner

Java
String assignmentExercise - file processing 
(Some aspects like in C programming language)

Read from a file and write to a file.  
Scanner - system.in input and system.out ouput and system.err error


First step - create a project in IDE which creates a file and a folder


1. open a file
2. Read from file and display
3. Then write to another file

Goals (secondary)
Later reading the file and statistics of file like # of characters

Package - in a folder somewhere (e.g. on the Desktop)
Doc program - uses the comment, and author, method arguments to take a method and convert it using html


1. For file processing
	a. Helps to have a file to work with - create it inside a text editor (data.txt)
	b. Scanner() method for infile;
	c. What if the file isn't there...
		i. exception (try simple not expensive handling of errors)
		ii.  throw and throws keywords - for exception handling Ch13 

2. Read from the file
	a. Java does use end of file, try and catch (with exceptions until end of file), or simply while statement

			while(input.hasNext())       //as long as there is a next line continue the loop				

	b. Inside loop - run a input/ouput (see .java code in Canvas)
	c. Close the file - always remember to do this since no compiler error

		* Additional processing line by line in file can be done within a nested loop
	
3. Write output to a file
	a. Path name (also applied to input file)
	b. Function from class PrintWriter associates new file and method
	c. Methods for the class (print, println, printf)
	d. For concurrent writing output to screen AND the file together, ok to have statements back to back



Java file types reads (best file processing among languages).  Binary, Text, Bytecode, and more Advanced concepts (Object).
