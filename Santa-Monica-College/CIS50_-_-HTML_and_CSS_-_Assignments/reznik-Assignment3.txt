Week 1 - Assignment 3

The difference between virus and worm, as I understand it is a virus may corrupt or add executable files to the system, which is not the goal of a worm.  The worm is a special kind of virus that replicates itself instead of altering existing files just propogates and creates much unneeded new files on a system.
