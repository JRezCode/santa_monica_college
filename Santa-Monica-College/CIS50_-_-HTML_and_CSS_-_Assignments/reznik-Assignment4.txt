W3C

The consortium founded by Web inventor Tim berner lee and many others to create the standards for protocols and design of the web interface known as HTTP.  There are many contributing factors (new programming languages, design principles), purposes (personal, business, social) and other important influential difference makers for the technology involved.  In addition to offering a forum for communication about the questions and issues relating to the standards of the WWW the consortium also acts as a governing body of how to implement change (I think).  And is an excellent resource for everyone (consumer or producer) of the web.
