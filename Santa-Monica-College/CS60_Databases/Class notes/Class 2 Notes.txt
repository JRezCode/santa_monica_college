Creating Tables in Database
	 -Data type: determine based on needs of the variable
	 -Conventions for variable names
	 -Table must have a primary key for the rows that are unique
	 -Attributes in a table have a determination if the value makes it possible to know the value of another

Entity entigrity in a Table
       -No null in the primary key
       -unique rows in the key attribute

Integrity Rules (entity and refererential integrity)
	  -The rules for deleting data in a rdb
	  -

Key types
Super key, e.g. 
Candidate key, e.g. serial number


Constraints
Not Null - constraint...place o a column to ensure rows have all values
Normal use in the process of creating a table (SQL)
Formal SQL constraint entered in after the column field attributes

       E.g.  CREATE TABLE.....
       	     	   ( field 1	Type1
		    field 2	Type2
		    ...
		    CONSTRAINT	type
		  );
		  
The constraint has a name just like other attributes would for column name, etc.
