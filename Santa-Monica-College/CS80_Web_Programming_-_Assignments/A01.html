    <div>I have more exposure to PHP and SQL than with HTML/CSS, and virtually
      none with Javascript, XML or Ajax. I hope to be working towards attaining
      these skills for becoming a full-stack web developer. In addition to this
      course I am planning to continue learning Java and perhaps Javascript to
      help support this goal. And I would also like to one day be able to
      integrate the languages like Java and Python into the web front-end or
      back-end in web-based projects.</div>
