Physical link
	-creating a connection
	-Ethernet (48-bit number address)
	
Data link layer
	-bridge?  hardware address ARP
	-captured in wireshark at the same section as IP/IPx
	-physical link may have address (ethernet mac address)
	-maybe a phone dialup to create
		-PPP
	
Networking layer
	-IP protocol communicates with both sides
	-TCP
	-UDP


Physical + data link = have to know the hardware address...
	e.g. Ethernet needs an ethernet address protocol to function
		
Networking layer = daily use and common for contacting other network hosts, etc.



Address resolution protocol
	-hardware addressing only works on hardware, software only on software
	-the protocol takes IP addresses and converts them to a hardware address
	-network card:
		a. Chip for processing
		b. memory (data)
		c. has software (builtin)	
	-method of broadcast implementation
		broadcast's the address - 6 FF's
		Type field on sender end and used on receiver side (0806)
	-method of translation
		arp protocol sends arp message (see cheat sheet for packet contents)
		receiver sends its hw address back to the broadcaster using unicast (direct not broadcast)
		it is recorded in the table of of arp for both computers		
	-once discovered network address is stored in a table
		efficiency, table in memory is checked first
		each time it has to discover it uses 3 messages (for discovering)
